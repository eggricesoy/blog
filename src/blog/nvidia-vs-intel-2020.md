## tl;dr

Nvidia was a chad shrek flexing. Intel was a salty jealous boi calling names.

## Nvidia RTX 30 series

Given that RTX 20 series [launched back in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series), a refresh in the product was somewhat expected.
But the unexpected high performance increase was a happy surprise for everyone:

tl;dw: you get the best performing card in previous gen for USD$499 in new generation. Nvidia also flexed 8k@60fps with RTX 3090 (ie. Titan).

### Well-announced

I can't find anything wrong with the Nvidia launch video. It is focused, the tech is well described (just deep enough) and features are presented well.

Nvidia later on released [more gameplay comparison videos](https://youtu.be/A7nYy7ZucxM) to further solidify their performance claims.

### Why is it so much better vs last gen?

I have a couple of theories:

1. RTX 20 sales were [underwhelming](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-20-sales-lower-than-expected-45-percent-revenue-decline/) and Nvidia wanted to regain attention.
2. Rumored AMD's Big Navi performs on par with RTX 3070 (ie. on par with RTX 2080Ti). Check out [Moore's Law Is Dead video](https://youtu.be/9zJL99lb7F4) regarding rumored Big Navi performance.
3. Nvidia is trying to prevent PC customers from switching to new console generation.

Whatever the reasons are, performance-per-dollar seems to be amazing with RTX 30 - which is obviously great for consumers.

## Intel Tiger Lake

Intel is losing CPU market share to AMD. [Steam HW survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/) reflects this in PC gaming market. Recent AMD laptops [dwarves Intel alternatives](https://youtu.be/4V3uB12mRrU) in performance and battery life. AMD server hardware is [significantly more tempting](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/netflix-amd-epyc-vs-intel-xeon-servers) even in layman's view.

Intel, not surprisingly, decided to steal the show from AMD - who announced the octa-core 4800U about 8 months ago:

### Textbook of bad announcements

The product stack seems solid and powerful. But unlike Nvidia's reveal, entire video tone can be summarized as 'jealous boomer whining'.

Literally 5 minutes in, Intel is name-calling AMD as _imitators_. I am guessing Intel is calling out AMD's CPU naming scheme. Then, does copying AMD64 instruction make Intel an imitator? How about Intel coping bigLittle design (ie. Intel glue)? Anyway, only _imitators_ use benchmarks, but Intel plans to be the best in benchmarks (watch `05:04` of the video for a good laugh).

I don't want this post to turn into '10 pages how Intel is unproductively whining', so I'll just stop here.

To be fair, I get that Intel is scared of AMD. I'd also want to drive AMD out of mobile market while they are still new before desktop history repeats itself in mobile.

### Easy things Intel can fix

I'd never accept my work presented in such an unprofessional presentation. I am sure many Intel engineers agree. I think Intel can fix this easily:

1. Pre-record the announcement. None of their talent has good stage performance.
2. Stop mentioning AMD, ever. The best way to make a man-child behave is by removing the trigger.
3. Don't follow-up on AMD's announcements. AMD also does petty things in their presentations (misleading graphs, for example - which Intel definitely did here).

## Two announcements, one winner

I think the videos got more eyeballs than usual thanks to 2020 being the year of staying indoors and few releases - ie. Intel's PR failure got amplified thanks to COVID. That said, if there wasn't Nvidia's announcement, Intel's failure would not have looked this bad.. May be not.
